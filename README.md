[Here is a link to the final project](https://vanessacleary.github.io/W-I-T-IT-LAB-Breast-Cancer-Awareness)

This project was built for the November 2021 Hackathon with Code Institute and IT Labs. The theme was Breast Cancer Awareness, by Women in Tech. We were tasked with creating a site that utilised technology to help raise awareness about breast cancer. It is designed to be responsive on a wide range of devices, whilst also being easy to navigate through.

Transgender people are often overlooked and under-represented as a group, especially when it comes to information and resources available relating to breast cancer. We wanted to help raise awareness about a lesser-known section of breast cancer, to help those who may be affected.

## Design

### Color Scheme

* The colors are based around the pink, blue and off-white on the transgender flag (and the transgender breast cancer ribbon).
* We chose this because our site is primarily focused on the transgender community.
* We also implimented a basic dark mode, to be fully inclusive, using darker versions of the transgender flag colors.

### Typography

We have used the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito) and [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway). These fonts are accessibility friendly, as the sans-serif family is easily readable to those with dyslexia.

Nunito is a well balanced sans-serif typeface, meaning it does not have any extending "serif" strokes at the end of each character. This font
brings a clean, crisp, balanced feel to the website. It renders with complete precision in all devices which increases legibility for users. As our
brand is aiming to enhance awareness and increase the reach of the information, this font denotes a calm, relaxed, informal, and approachable set of feelings.
Nunito in our project is used as our content font and is utilised on large contextual reading pieces throughout the project.

Raleway is an elegant sans-serif typeface, and sports a display face natural property. A display face font is used for headings/titles/slogans etc and being a more eccentric sans-serif typeface, rather than a restrained sans-serif typeface means it is a perfect font for our headings/titles throughout our project. Like Nunito, and as a sans-serif typeface, Raleway does not sport any extending "serifs" per character making this font a perfect companion to Nunito and to our users reading/viewing our website on all devices.

“Sans-Serif” is used as the default backup font in cases where these fonts have difficulty loading.

### Imagery

* We used the transgender breast cancer ribbon as our favicon, as our site is focused on raising awareness about breast cancer within the transgender community.
* We used the transgender icon as our logo.
* The images we have used are all related to breast cancer, or to the transgender community.
* The models we used are rough designs of the male and the female torso, to help our users feel at ease about the topic.
* The Transgender Breast Cancer Ribbon was added to the resources section in replace of bullet to for the following reasons:
  * Re-enforcing our mission and creating awareness around the flag and breast cancer ribbon.
  * Styling reasons, the ribbon is much more appealing than bullet points.

### Features

The site itself utilises a primary Single-Page-Application style build with secondary/tertiary stand-alone pages added, removing unnecessary bloat from the SPA itself. The SPA is constructed and developed on the `index.html` page, which is situated in the root directory, and encompasses the project's primary information and user group engagement sections.

Within the SPA, the structure is comprised of:

* Navbar to allow for easy navigation within the SPA using Smooth scrolling
* Hero image section, maintaining a primary landing image
* Awareness section, which holds key informative detail for the user in bite-size fashion
* Support section, which allocates helpful topics for the user
* Resources section, which includes links to other related sites that may be useful to a user of our site
* Contact section, allowing the user to get in touch with brand ambassadors
* Footer which contains social links/secondary pages such as Privacy/Accessibility statements

Tertiary pages include:

* 404 Error page in case of incorrect/adverse navigation to pages/directories that may not exist within this project.
* 500 Error page in case of internal server errors.

#### Awareness Section

The Awareness section utilises html/css/js to promote information about Breast Cancer to an under-promoted User Group, Transgender People. Information in this section was referenced from multiple sources and is cited below in the Credits of this README.

HTML/CSS is used to structure the content and appropriate section layout using up-to-date methods such as Semantic use of HTML and CSS Grid. 3D Model viewers are implemented to promote the human body and in it's native primitive form. The library used to implement these 3D models is [Model Viewer by Google](https://modelviewer.dev/). On page load, the `model-viewer` elements load both models simultaneously to reduce render on view motion on the site, and User interaction controls are removed by default to enhance user experience and accessibility.

Some JS is utilised to detect the current device viewport width, and if less than 992px wide, the `field-of-view` attribute value of the `model-viewer` elements is updated to reflect the smaller viewport allowing for more of the 3D models to be viewed by the user, saving on vital real estate on the device.

The 3D models utilised in the `model-viewer` and situated in the assets directory in their own sub-directory called "models", were obtained from [free3d.com](https://free3d.com/), and heavily modified in Blender to add custom lighting styled on the Transgender Community's Flag, and to add increased sub-division modifier and shadow rendering. Links to both models in Credits section in this README.

#### Resources section

The Resources section utilises html/css to promote information about Breast Cancer to an under-promoted User Group, Transgender People. Information in this section was referenced from multiple sources and is linked to offical sources and cited below in the Credits of this README.

HTML/CSS is used to structure the content and appropriate section layout using up-to-date methods such as Semantic use of HTML and CSS Grid. A 3 column grid was used.

The grid was used to display 3 step journey of a Breast Cancer Diagnosis, 'Have I got Breast Cancer?', 'Diagnosed with Breast Cancer?' 'Survive and Thrive'. This was very important to display. This was designed to take the user on a journey from Breast Cancer concerns to aftercare. It also is designed so someone can get use of the website no matter what stage the find the website.

The section includes projects from fellow Code Institute Hackathonians. This is an important feature to showcase the many other fantastic resources available for anyone wanting awareness around Breast Cancer be it for Transgender people, Women or Men. It is also important to showcase the important work, research, passionate and creative work being done and focused on this important topic.

#### Contact section

Our site has a contact form so that users can contact us with any questions they have. This section includes a responsive form which users can use to contact Bust IT with any inquries.

The contact us form uses emailJS to send a reliable form.
Once a user clicks the submit buttom, they recieve an alert indicating that the email was recieved successfully, or an error if there are delivery issues.

EmailJs was the prefered email service for Bust It as it is free, but also reliable. Once a user sends a message through the contact form, all their information is captured and recieved by Bust IT, this way Bust IT can tailor what information and resources to send to their users.

[Back to Top](#bust-it-cancer-without-borders)

### Solved Bugs

1. There was an overflow-x on the site that we couldn't find where it was coming from.
    * We checked all the elements on the page for unexpected padding and margin, but found none.
    * We checked through the code and saw that one of the CSS resets we'd used was `width: 100vw;`.
    * We realised that this doesn't take into account the y-axis scroll bar.
    * We changed this to `width: 100%;`, which fixed this bug.

### Known Bugs

* There are no known bugs left in this project. If you find one, please contact the development team via the contact form.

### Lighthouse

We tested our website using DevTools Lighthouse feature, and got these results:

#### Desktop Lighthouse

![Lighthouse desktop first try](assets/docs/lighthouse-desktop.png)

#### Mobile Lighthouse

![Lighthouse mobile first try](assets/docs/lighthouse-mobile.png)

#### Performance

* We were happy with this score.
* Our original score for this was 37 on desktop, due to the 3D models we have included.
* We compressed the images and the 3D models to improve this score.
* We were incredibly happy with the amount of improvement we were able to make here.
* Unfortunately this score is still too low on mobile, although it has improved from 28. The 3D models are really affecting the performance on mobile.
* We have plans to continue improving this in the future.

#### Accessibility

* We were happy with this score.
* We took steps throughout the development process to ensure that this site would be accessible to everyone.

#### Best Practices

* We were happy with this score.
* We ensured to adhere to best practices throughout the site.

#### SEO

* We were happy with this score.
* The only thing we lost points on was that the links aren't crawlable.
* This is because we've used sections within our HTML to link to, rather than other HTML pages.
